### 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious and driven developer with a deep passion for computer science, artificial intelligence, and building things that matter.

Since a young age, I've been drawn to technology, web development, and design — not just as tools, but as forms of expression and innovation.

- 🧩 Interested in: Algorithms, AI, Systems Thinking, and Software Architecture
- 💡 Exploring: Clean Code, Scalable Systems, and Problem-Solving as an art
- 🌱 Always growing through hands-on learning, open-source, and curiosity
